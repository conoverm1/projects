2023 Data Science Summer Experience

Worked with Xavier University's Office of Institutional Research to develop a profile of students who 
are retained from year to year. Data preparation/wrangling to make visualizations to present to the 
provost office. The data itself that we were given is confidential but the code and graphs doesn't 
contain any identifying information.

a data set with demographic information about each precinct.
